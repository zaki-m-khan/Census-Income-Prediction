I also considered dropping capital-loss because more than 95% of the values were 0, but decided to keep it because it could be used later and capital-gains is still included. The new list is: age, education-num, marital-status, workclass, occupation, relationship, race, sex_selfID, capital-gain, hours-per-week, native-country. I decided to keep these because they could have correlation with the income label and were cleaned data.\n",

I also detected outliers in hours-per-week using IQR method and attempted to use windsorize as we had done in the course previously, but couldn't actually augment the data so I ended up using .clip() which worked. I did one-hot encoding to all the categorical columns to make it friendly for the ML model. I dropped the redundant and non-predictive features as well.\n",

Then i will address the class imbalance i analyzed earlier by looking metrics other than accuracy. I hope to improve the model performance by truing different models, seeing if i can use cross-validation, or tuning hyperparameters. Finally, i will choose the best performing model based on the metrics."
